# React Accessibility Configurator (ReactA11yConfig)

Accessibility Configurator is an accessibility tool that can be plugged into a web app as a module and it will help manage your web accessibility like text, colour, and audio control.

This repo contains other unrelated code because initially, it was meant to be a monorepo of packages. But I am working on moving the Accessibility Configurator to its own repo and then release a stable version for npm public consumption. But before then, you can check out the code below:
